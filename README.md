This is a project made by 2 collaborators: Andrew Piela and George Lundgren. It is a tool that uses PyTorch to look at handwritten numbers and figure out what digit they are.

We used the MNIST dataset for this project.

Accuracy - We ran it for 10 epochs and got 97.87% accuracy on the final test.

How it works - there are two main parts to the code:
  model.py: This has the layers for the neural network.
  train.py: This loads the data and runs the training loop to teach the model.
